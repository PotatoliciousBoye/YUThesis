# YUThesis
Yalova University Computer Engineering Thesis Work

The point of this thesis work is to see if it is possible to identify a user by using machine learning keystroke dynamics. User data will be gathered by making the users play a video game and, recording keystrokes and mouse movement while the user is playing. This ReadMe file will be updated as the project goes on to give more info about the thesis.

___________

Data for this thesis will be gathered by making the users play a first person shooter game called .kkrieger (Can be found at this link: http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=12036) while a keylogger runs at the background.The data gathering process have been simplified such that the participants only need to download the batch prepared(From: http://bit.do/ThesisDataGather), run ThesisDataGather.exe, play the game and send the output file. The keylogger has no connection to any servers or to the internet itself and will only log the keys that are required to play the game because of safety reasons. Because of this, participants need to send the output file either directly to me, or to my dropbox (http://bit.do/thesisDataUpload). The game .kkrieger is chosen for this work because of its file size, simple mechanics and it being a first person shooter thus making the participant use both the keyboard and the mouse extensively throught the data gathering session.
